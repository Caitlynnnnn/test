                <h2>Current Projects</h2>
                <p>I am currently working on a new dating app called "Crushy" with my co-founder Carson. The app has two modes: 'surf' for casual hookups with a picture focus, and 'dive' for deeper connections with a bio focus.</p>
                <p>We recently applied for seed funding and are awaiting good news. Additionally, I am looking for a new full-time job as a designer or project manager to support my family.</p>
